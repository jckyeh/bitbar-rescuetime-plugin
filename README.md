# bitbar-rescuetime-plugin
Display your RescueTime productivity pulse (and more!) on your Mac menu bar. Based on [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar).

This plugin displays your “productivity score,” and how much time is “very productive” of total hours logged. The drop down menu shows you your “productivity score” and percentage of your time that was “very productive” over the past seven days. If your score is above 70, you get a check mark for that day (67% is the average)!
